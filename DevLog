LaserGame Project

Preliminary Structure:
	-Starts with initial configuration of Level:
		-Will have a tube for spawning Lasers
		-Receiver to catch Lasers
		-Preset blocks for bouncing
	-waits for user to edit GameSpace by either:
		-dragging box from itemBar onto GameSpace
		-moving existing items in GameSpace around with mouse
		-Blocks will be fixed to grid, and will snap to integer grid locations when being dragged (x, y) x,y being Integers.
	-if user hits play:
		-restrict editing
		-spawn Laser with constant velocity
		-start simulating according to physics laws:
			- Lasers bounce elastically from blocks
		-have a time variable at point? or reset time to 0?
		-if the laser fulfills receiver requirements
			-stop simulation
		-if user hits stop:
			-destroy any in game lasers
			-reset to initial configuration excluding items that the user has edited
	-If receiver fulfills expectation	
		-player wins

Themes to keep in mind:
	- Test based design - design tests for methods first before you design the method itself.
	- Make PC to mobile version easy to convert - do not rely on PC specific design

Ideas for later
	- Percent counter above receiver that shows how much laser still needs to go into the receiver
	- receiver only catches from one side

02-10:
	- First commit initial set up to repository
	- Work on getting basic class structures defined:
		- Main.cs - A runner Class that has the main game loop in its update()
		- UI.cs - Class for the UI:
			- Will contain a Panel for holding items that can be dropped into the GameSpace
			- Have editing objects existing on GameSpace in Main?
			- Or have Drag-able script on Cubes as well?
		- Block.cs - Basic block Class that will interact with lasers. 
		- Laser.cs - Laser Class. Lasers bounce of blocks elastically
		- Receiver.cs - Receiver class that will catch lasers
	- Make prefabs for Laser, Block
	- Make basic UI prefabs
	- Create tests for bouncing lasers
